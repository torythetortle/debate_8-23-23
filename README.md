# Analysis steps
   
## To find just most common words by person-
    1- Separate *by person* into seperate files

    2- Use lastname_word.csv as the file name (IE Pence_eggs.csv)

    3-Ensure that there are no spelling errors, capitolization, periods, etc. Its better to have it as raw as possible. 

    4- Create a new folder called *lastname_word_analysis.csv* (IE pence_common) and place the file in it
   
    5- Make a copy of the file *common.ipynb* and place into the folder- this is a .ipynb pandas file
   
    6- Replace the name "EGG" with your file name

    7- Replace the number 5 with the number of most common words you want to see.
