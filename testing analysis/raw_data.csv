Lester Holt,0:08,"Mission. Drafted tonight's format and the rules have been agreed to by the campaigns. The 90 minute debate is divided into six segments each 50 minutes long. We'll explore three topic areas tonight, achieving prosperity, America's direction, and securing America. At the start of each segment, I will ask the same lead off question to both candidates and they will each have up to two minutes to respond. From that point until the end of the segment, we'll have an open discussion. The questions are mine and have not been shared with the commission or the campaigns. The audience here in the room has agreed to remain silent so that we can focus on what the candidates are saying. I will invite you to applaud however at this moment as we welcome the candidates democratic nominee for president of the United States, Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee for president of the United States. Trump. Good luck to you,"
Lester Holt,1:19,Luck to you.
Hilary Clinton,2:31,"Well, thank you Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us. The central question in this election is really what kind of country we want to be and what kind of future we'll build together. Today is my granddaughter's second birthday, so I think about this a lot. First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. That means we need new jobs, good jobs with rising incomes. I want us to invest in you. I want us to invest in your future. That means jobs and infrastructure in advanced manufacturing, in innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy and small business because most of the new jobs will come from small business. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee finally, equal pay for women's work. I also want to see more companies do profit sharing."
Lester Holt,4:35,"Secretary Clinton. Thank you, Mr. Trump. The same question to you. It's about putting money, more money into the pockets of American workers. You have up to two Minutes."
Donald Trump,4:42,"Thank you, Lester. Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico, they're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product, they're devaluing their currency and there's nobody in our government to fight them, and we have a very good fight and we have a winning fight because they're using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China and many other countries are doing the same thing. So we're losing our good jobs. So many of them, when you look at what's happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it's the eighth wonder of the world. They're building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants with the United States. As he said, not so much so Ford is leaving."
Lester Holt,6:51,"Secretary Clinton, would you like to respond?"
Hilary Clinton,6:53,"Well, I think that trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5% of the world's population. We have to trade with the other 95% and we need to have smart, fair trade deals. We also though need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percents of the people in this country than we've ever had. I call it trumped up, trickle down because that's exactly what it would be. That is not how we grow the economy. We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes. I think we come at it from somewhat different perspectives."
Lester Holt,8:36,Me follow up with Mr. Trump if I can. You've talked about creating 25 million jobs and you've promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans. How are we going to bring back the industries that have left this country for cheaper labor overseas? How specifically are you going to tell American manufacturers that you have to come back?
Donald Trump,8:54,"Well, for one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars with some of the greatest assets in the world. And I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. Our country's in deep trouble. We don't know what we're doing When it comes to devaluations and all of these countries all over the world, especially China, they're the best, the best ever at it. What they're doing to us is a very, very sad thing. So we have to do that. We have to renegotiate our trade deals unless they're taking our jobs, they're giving incentives, they're doing things that frankly we don't do. Lemme give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax. We're in a different system When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax when they sell in automatic 16% approximately when they sell into us."
Lester Holt,10:19,Me interrupt just a moment.
Donald Trump,10:20,"Secretary Clinton and others, politicians should have been doing this for years. Not right now because of the fact that we've created a movement, they should have been doing this for years. What's happened to our jobs and our country and our economy generally is look, we owe $20 trillion. We cannot do it any longer. Lester,"
Lester Holt,10:42,"Back to the question though. How do you bring back, specifically bring back jobs, American manufacturers, how do you make them bring the jobs back?"
Donald Trump,10:49,"Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. I could name, I mean there are thousands of them. They're leaving and they're leaving in bigger numbers than ever. And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck, but if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong. And once you say you're going to have to tax them coming in, and our politicians never do this because they have special interests and the special interests want those companies to leave because in many cases they own the companies. So what I'm saying is we can stop them from leaving. We have to stop them from leaving and that's a big, big factor."
Lester Holt,11:33,Let me let Secretary Clinton get here.
Hilary Clinton,11:34,"Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago, we had the worst financial crisis, the great recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slash taxes on the wealthy failed to in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street and created a perfect storm. In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said back in 2006, gee, I hope it does collapse because then I can go in and buy some and make some money. Well, it did collapse. That's"
Donald Trump,12:13,Called business
Hilary Clinton,12:14,"By the way. 9 million people, 9 million people lost their jobs, 5 million people lost their homes and $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. Now we have come back from that abyss and it has not been easy. So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy. But the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place. Independent experts have looked at what I've proposed and looked at what Donald's proposed. And basically they've said this, that if his tax plan, which would blow up the debt by over $5 trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middle class families compared to the wealthy were to go into effect, we would lose three and a half million jobs and maybe have another recession. They've looked at my plans and they've said, okay, if we can do this and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy, take clean energy. Some country is going to be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century. Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. I think it's real."
Donald Trump,13:36,I did not. Science
Hilary Clinton,13:37,Is
Donald Trump,13:37,Real. I do not say that. And
Hilary Clinton,13:38,"I think it's not important that we grip this and deal with it both at home and abroad. And here's what we can do. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs. That's a lot of new economic activity. So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place. Mr."
Donald Trump,14:14,"Trump, she talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company or country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. Now look, I'm a great believer in all forms of energy, but we're putting a lot of people out of work. Our energy policies are a disaster. Our country is losing so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. You can't do what you're looking to do with 20 trillion in debt. The Obama administration from the time they've come in is over 230 years worth of debt and he's topped it. He's doubled it in a course of almost eight years, seven and a half years to be semi exact. So I will tell you this, we have to do a much better job at keeping our jobs and we have to do a much better job at giving companies incentive to build new companies or to expand because they're not doing it. And all you have to do is look at Michigan and look at Ohio a nd look at all of these places where so many of their jobs and their companies are just leaving. They're gone. And Hillary, I just ask you this, you've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years you've been doing it and now you're just starting to think of solutions. Excuse me, I will bring back jobs. You can't bring back jobs. Well,"
Hilary Clinton,15:38,Actually I have thought about this quite a bit.
Donald Trump,15:41,"Yeah, for 30 years"
Hilary Clinton,15:42,"I have, well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again. Well, he"
Donald Trump,15:53,Approved.
Hilary Clinton,15:53,"He made a new jobs, he approved balanced"
Donald Trump,15:55,"Budget, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved in this"
Hilary Clinton,15:58,"Country. Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up. Also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts, when I was in the Senate, I had a number of trade deals that came before me and I held them all to the same test. Will they create jobs in America? Will they raise incomes in America and are they good for our national security? Some of them I voted for the biggest one, a multinational one known as Kafta, I voted against. And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals, but let's not assume that trade is the only challenge we have in the economy. I think it is a part of it and I've said what I'm going to do, I'm going to have a special prosecutor. We're going to enforce the trade deals we have and we're going to hold people accountable. When I was secretary of State, we actually increased American exports globally, 30%. We increased them to China, 50%. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs."
Donald Trump,17:04,"Well, you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years. Any number"
Hilary Clinton,17:07,"You want to do, well, I've been a senator. You haven't done it. You haven't done, I have been a secretary of state and I have done"
Donald Trump,17:12,"Your husband's side nafta, which was one of the worst things that ever happened. Well, that's manufacturing industry"
Hilary Clinton,17:18,Is European.
Donald Trump,17:18,"You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacturers down 30, 40, sometimes 50%. NAFTA is the worst trade deal, maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country. And now you want to approve transpacific partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate, but you know that if you did win, you would approve that and that will be almost as bad as nafta. Nothing will ever top"
Hilary Clinton,17:50,"Nafta. Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in, you called"
Donald Trump,18:01,"It the gold standard. Well, I"
Hilary Clinton,18:03,Hope
Donald Trump,18:03,You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen. No. And then you heard what I said about it and all of a sudden you were against it.
Hilary Clinton,18:11,"Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated, which I was not responsible for, I concluded it. I wrote about that."
Donald Trump,18:26,So is it President Obama's fault? Is it President Obama's
Hilary Clinton,18:29,"Fault? He even announced, look, there"
Donald Trump,18:31,Are secretary. Is it President Obama's fault?
Hilary Clinton,18:34,There are
Donald Trump,18:34,Different because he's pushing it.
Hilary Clinton,18:35,"There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. And I think it's important to look at what we need to do to get the economy going. Again, that's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add 5 trillion to the debt, but you have"
Donald Trump,18:55,No
Hilary Clinton,18:56,"Plan. Oh, I do secretary, you have no"
Donald Trump,18:59,"Plan,"
Hilary Clinton,19:00,A book about it. It's called Stronger Together. You can pick it up tomorrow. That's about all you folks at the bookstore or at an airport near you. We're going
Lester Holt,19:07,"To move to,"
Hilary Clinton,19:07,"But it's because I see this. We need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth. We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business. So we have a very robust set of plans and people who have looked at both of our plans have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us three and a half million jobs and explode. You"
Donald Trump,19:35,"Are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place. And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs, but regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence. When I go around Lester, I tell you this, I've been all over and when I go around despite the tax cut, the things that businesses and people like the most is the fact that I'm cutting regulation. You have regulations on top of regulations and new companies cannot form, and old companies are going out of business and you want to increase the regulations and make 'em even worse. I'm going to cut regulations, but I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you are going to raise taxes. Big league. End of story. Let me get"
Lester Holt,20:35,You to pause right there because we're going to move into the next segment. We're going to talk
Hilary Clinton,20:39,"That can't be left with stand. Please, please just take"
Lester Holt,20:41,"30 seconds, then we're going to"
Hilary Clinton,20:42,"Go on. I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims and so facts. We have taken the homepage of my website, hillary clinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact checker. So if you want to see in real time what the facts are, please go and take a look"
Donald Trump,21:00,"Because, and take a look at mine also and not"
Hilary Clinton,21:03,Add a penny to the debt. And your plans would add 5 trillion to the debt. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy because they have made all the gains in the economy. And I think it's time that the wealthy in corporations paid their fair share to support
Lester Holt,21:30,"This market. Well, you just opened the next segment, which well,"
Donald Trump,21:32,Can I just finish?
Lester Holt,21:34,I should. I'm give you a chance right here. Within 15
Donald Trump,21:37,"Website, she's going to raise taxes $1.3 trillion, Mr. Trump, and look at her website. You know what? It's no different than this. She's telling us how to fight isis. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too"
Lester Holt,21:53,"Much. The next segment, we're continuing the subject."
Hilary Clinton,21:56,"Well, I have a plan to fight is"
Donald Trump,21:58,"No, no. You're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No, we're not. See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No, no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life."
Hilary Clinton,22:11,"Folks, go to the please the fact checkers. Get"
Lester Holt,22:14,"To work. Folks, you are unpacking a lot here and we're still in the issue of achieving prosperity. And I want to talk about taxes. The fundamental difference between the two of you concerns the wealthy Secretary Clinton, you're calling for a tax increase in the wealthiest Americans. I'd like you to further defend that. And Mr. Trump, you're calling for tax cuts for the wealthy. I'd like you to defend that. And this next two minute answer goes to you, Mr. Trump. Well,"
Donald Trump,22:36,"I'm really calling for major jobs because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs. They're going to expand their companies, they're going to do a tremendous job. I'm getting rid of the carried interest provision. And if you really look, it's not a tax. It's really not a great thing for the wealthy. It's a great thing for middle class. It's a great thing for companies to expand and when these people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies and when they're going to bring two and a half trillion dollars back from overseas where they can't bring the money back because politicians like Secretary Clinton, the money back because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape. So what is so bad? So what they're doing is they're leaving our country and they're, believe it or not leaving because taxes are too high."
Lester Holt,24:15:00,"Alright, you have two minutes on the same question To defend tax increases on the wealthiest American Secretary Clinton, I"
Hilary Clinton,24:21:00,"Have a feeling that by the end of this evening, I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened. Why not? Why not? Yeah, why not just join the debate by saying more crazy things? Now let me say,"
Donald Trump,24:35:00,"Hey, there's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into this"
Lester Holt,24:41:00,Country. This is Secretary Clinton's two minutes please. Yes.
Hilary Clinton,24:44:00,"Yeah. Well, let's start the clock again. Lester, we've looked at your tax proposals. I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation bringing back of money that's stranded overseas. I happen to then you didn't. I happen to support that in a way that will actually work to our benefit, but when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now that Trump loophole because it would so advantage you and the business you do. You've proposed a name that approach"
Donald Trump,25:24:00,Who
Hilary Clinton,25:26:00,"Tax benefit for your family. And when you look at what you are proposing, how much, much for my family it is how, as I said, trumped up, trickle down, trickle down did not work. It got us into the mess We were in two and nine. Slashing taxes on the wealthy hasn't worked. And a lot of really smart wealthy people know that and they are saying, Hey, we need to do more to make the contributions we should be making to rebuild the middle class. I don't think top down works in America. I think building the middle class, investing in the middle class, making college debt-free so more young people can get their education, helping people refinance, tax, their debt from college at a lower rate. Those are the kinds of things that will really boost the economy. Broad-based inclusive growth is what we need in America. Not more advantages for people at the very top."
Lester Holt,26:27:00,"Mr. Trump, typical"
Donald Trump,26:28:00,"Politician, all talk, no action. Sounds good. Doesn't work, never going to happen. Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on. Now, look, we have the worst revival of an economy since the Great Depression. And believe me, we're in a bubble right now and the only thing that looks good is the stock market. But if you raise interest rates even a little bit, that's going to come crashing down. We are in a big fat ugly bubble and we better be awfully careful. And we have a fed that's doing political things. This Janet Yellen of the Fed. The Fed is doing political by keeping the interest rates at this level. And believe me, the day Obama goes off and he leaves and he goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf. When they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen because the Fed is not doing their job. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton."
Lester Holt,27:32:00,"Mr. Trump, we're talking about the burden that Americans have to pay yet you have not released your tax returns. And the reason nominees have released their returns for decades is that voters will know if their potential president owes money to who owes it to and any business conflicts don't. Americans have a right to know if there are any conflicts of interest, I"
Donald Trump,27:53:00,"Don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit and it'll be released and as soon as the audit's finished, it'll be released. But you will learn more about Donald Trump by going down to the federal elections where I filed a 104 page essentially financial statement of sorts. The forms that they have, it shows income. In fact, the income I just looked today, the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, 694 million. If you would've told me I was going to make that 15 or 20 years ago, I would've been very surprised. But that's the kind of thinking that our country needs when we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world. It's the kind of thinking that our country needs because everybody, Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with of almost 800 billion a year. You know what that is? That means who's negotiating these trade deals. We have people that are political hacks, negotiating our trade deals. The I R"
Lester Holt,28:59:00,"S says an audit of your taxes. You're perfectly free to release your taxes during an audit. And so the question, does the public's right to know outweigh your personal?"
Donald Trump,29:09:00,"Well, I told you I will release them as soon as the audit. Look, I've been under audit almost for 15 years. I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited. I said, you get audited. I get audited almost every year and in a way I should be complaining. I'm not even complaining. I don't mind it. It's almost become a way of life. I get audited by the I R S, but other people don't. I will say this, we have a situation in this country that has to be taken care of. I will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 emails that have been deleted. As soon as she releases them, I will release. I release my tax returns and that's against my lawyers. They say don't do it. I will tell you this, no. In fact, watching shows to reading the papers, almost every lawyer says you don't release your returns until the audit's complete. When the audit's complete, I'll do it, but I would go against them if she releases her email."
Lester Holt,30:09:00,So it's negotiable.
Donald Trump,30:11:00,"It's not negotiable. No. Let her release the email. Why did she delete 33,000? Well,"
Lester Holt,30:15:00,"I'll let her ask that, but let me just admonish the audience one more time. There was an agreement we did ask you to be silent so it would be helpful for us. Secretary Clinton."
Hilary Clinton,30:23:00,"Well, I think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here for 40 years. Everyone running for president has released their tax returns. You can go and see nearly, I think 39, 40 years of our tax returns. But everyone has done it. We know the I R Ss has made clear, there is no prohibition on releasing it when you're under audit. So you've got to ask yourself why won't he release his tax returns? And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about 650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks. Or maybe he doesn't want the American people. All of you watching tonight to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax."
Donald Trump,31:34:00,That makes me smart. If
Hilary Clinton,31:35:00,"He's paid zero, that means zero for troops, zero for vets, zero for schools or health. And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are because it must be something really important, even terrible that he's trying to hide. And the financial disclosure statement, they don't give you the tax rate, they don't give you all the details that tax returns would. And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see and I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns because there's something he's hiding. And we'll guess we'll keep guessing at what it might be that he's hiding. But I think the question is were he ever to get near the White House? What would be those conflicts? Who does he owe money to? Well, he owes you the answers to that and he should provide them."
Donald Trump,32:38:00,He also raised the issue of your emails. Do you want to respond to
Hilary Clinton,32:41:00,"That? I do. I made a mistake using a private email, that's"
Donald Trump,32:46:00,For sure.
Hilary Clinton,32:47:00,"And if I had to do it over again, I would obviously do it differently. But I'm not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake and I take responsibility for that."
Donald Trump,32:57:00,"Mr. Trump. That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. Okay. That was not a mistake that was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the fifth Amendment, taking the fifth so they're not prosecuted when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the fifth, I think it's disgraceful. And believe me, this country really thinks it's disgraceful also as far as my tax returns, you don't learn that much from tax returns. That I can tell you you learn a lot from financial disclosure and you should go down and take a look at that. The other thing I'm extremely under leveraged the report that said 650, which by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business said, boy, that's really not a lot of money. It's not a lot of money relative to Roy had the buildings that were in question, they said in the same report, which was actually, it wasn't even a bad story to be honest with you, but the buildings are worth $3.9 billion and the 650 isn't even on that."
Hilary Clinton,35:39:00,"The next maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years. And the other thing I think is important point out, it"
Donald Trump,35:46:00,"Would be squander too. Believe me,"
Hilary Clinton,35:48:00,"If your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that. Your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys. And indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald. I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery, installers like my dad was, who you refuse to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do. We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use and you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you. Maybe"
Donald Trump,36:45:00,"He didn't do a good job. And I was unsatisfied with his work, which our country should do too."
Hilary Clinton,36:50:00,"The thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced and then refused to pay them. I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you. He provided a good middle class life for us. But the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides. And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times. There are a lot of great business people that have never taken bankruptcy. Once you call yourself the king of debt, you talk about leverage, you even at one time suggested that you would try to negotiate down the national debt of the United States. Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government. That's what"
Donald Trump,37:57:00,Mr.
Hilary Clinton,37:58:00,Clear about that
Donald Trump,38:00:00,"Look, it's all words. It's all sound bites. I built an unbelievable company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, real estate assets anywhere in the world beyond the United States, in Europe, lots of different places. It's an unbelievable company. But on occasion, four times we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn't get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taking advantage of the laws of the nation. Now if you want to change the laws, been there a long time, change the laws, but I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I'm running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees for my companies. And that's what I do. But what she doesn't say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me."
Lester Holt,39:51:00,"Country. Well, we're well behind schedule. So I want to move to our next segment. We move into our next segment talking about America's direction. And let's start by talking about race."
